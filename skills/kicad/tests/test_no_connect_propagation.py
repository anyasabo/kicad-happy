"""Regression test: a stray no-connect marker on a connected multi-pin net must
not flip every IC/connector pin on that net to NO_CONNECT in ic_pin_analysis.

Bug: the net-level `no_connect` flag is set when *any* point in a net's
union-find group is an NC marker. ic_pin_analysis used that flag directly, so a
single stray NC marker absorbed into a rail (e.g. VBUS/GND) reported all of that
rail's pins as NO_CONNECT. Fixed by only honoring the net-level flag for
single-pin nets (analyze_schematic.py, has_no_connect).

Fixture `nc_marker_on_multipin_net.kicad_sch`: a 2-pin connector J1 with both
pins on net VBUS, plus a stray no_connect marker joined to VBUS via a same-name
label — so VBUS is a 2-pin net carrying the no_connect flag.

Run directly (`python3 test_no_connect_propagation.py`) or via pytest.
